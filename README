pkt_generator: Packet Generator
===============================
Simple UDP client/server to send incrementing integer values as strings.

What?
=====
This program acts as either a sender or receiver sending or receiving UDP
packets of (specified length) with a text string representing a monotonically
increasing value (a counter).  If the length is too small (or zero) then the
minum payload is sent.  Else, the payload (the string representation of the
counter) and a buffer of zeros is sent.

For example, if 10 packets are sent, strings "1" to "10" are the payload for
packets 1 to 10 respectively.  Strings instead of binary values makes parsing
with `tcpdump -X' pretty trivial.

This program operates on port 6666 (not quite the beast).

Receive or sending information is output to a file 'pkt_generator.log'
