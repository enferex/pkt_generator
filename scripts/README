These scripts make using the pkt_generator tool a bit simpler for conducting
tests.

'client.sh': Runs a client version of pkt_generator (ctrl-C) to safely exit
'server.sh': Runs a server version of pkt_generator

Both store sending and receiving data (ifconfig and ethtool) data in the
resulting test directory to verify if the kernel or driver is handling the
packets that are to be sent/received.

Tests are named based on specified number of packets to send and payload length.
